This project was done in the course “Software engineering” at University of Reykjavík. 
This group, DreamTeam made a Rick and Morty version of the popular game tic tac toe. This game is a two-player game where the players take turns in marking the spaces in a 3X3 grid. The first player to get three of his marks in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal row wins the game. If neither player gets their mark three times in a row before the grid is full, the game will end in a draw.
